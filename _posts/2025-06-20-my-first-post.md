# Welcome to My Blog!

This is my first blog post using GitHub Pages and Jekyll. I'm excited to share my journey learning web development and GitHub.

## What I've Learned So Far
- How to create repositories
- Working with branches
- Using Markdown
- Setting up GitHub Pages

I look forward to writing more posts about my coding adventures!
